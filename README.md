# For Developers:

## Cloning the Repository
1.  First, navigate to the directory that you would like to clone the repository into using commands like:
    -   `cd`: to change your working directory.
    -   `cd ..`  to "go back" a level in your directory tree.
2.  Next, clone the remote repository and create a local copy on your machine using this command:

-   `git clone https://github.com/maxsg5/CS-Hackathon.git`

3.  Now you can see the contents of the remote repository on your machine by moving into the newly cloned directory:

-   `cd CS-Hackathon`
-   `ls -la`

## Opening the project in Unity
1. Open Unity Hub, navigate to the projects tab, and select add project from disk option

2. Add the folder of your cloned repository. The unity editor should now start to build your project.
